## 📖 What Is This App?

- **Users** can submit their AI projects with screenshots
- **Admins** can review submissions and select winners
- **Everyone** can view the public gallery of projects

## 🧩 Technologies Used (Simple Explanation)

### React ⚛️
**What it is**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces  
**What it does here**: Creates interactive components (buttons, forms, cards)  
**You'll see**: Files with `.tsx` extension, components with `<Button>`, `<Card>`, etc.

### Next.js 🔷
**What it is**: A React framework that adds routing and server features  
**What it does here**: 
- Handles page navigation (`/`, `/submit`, `/gallery`)
- Renders pages on the server for better performance
- Organizes our app structure  

**You'll see**: `app/` folder with `page.tsx` files for each route

### Clerk 🔐
**What it is**: Authentication service (login/signup)  
**What it does here**:
- Manages user accounts (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- Provides user information (name, email)
- Handles user roles (admin, moderator, user)  

**You'll see**: `<SignInButton>`, `useUser()`, `auth()` in code

### Firebase 🔥
**What it is**: Google's backend platform  
**What it does here**:
- **Firestore**: Database that stores submissions
- **Storage**: Stores screenshot images
- **Security Rules**: Controls who can read/write data  

**You'll see**: `db`, `storage`, `collection()`, `addDoc()` in code

### Tailwind CSS 🎨
**What it is**: CSS framework with utility classes  
**What it does here**: Styles the app with pre-made classes  
**You'll see**: `className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-4"` (classes that style elements)

### shadcn/ui 🎭
**What it is**: Pre-built React components  
**What it does here**: Provides ready-to-use UI components (buttons, cards, dialogs)  
**You'll see**: Components imported from `@/components/ui/`

## 🛠️ Setup (Step-by-Step for Beginners)

### Prerequisites (Install These First):

1. **Node.js** (version 18+): [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
3. **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Get the Code

```bash
# Open terminal/command prompt
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd C:\code\react\

# If you have the code already, you're in the right place!
# Otherwise, clone from Git:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd DevfestCompetitionForm
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# This downloads all required packages
npm install

# Wait for it to finish (can take 2-5 minutes)
```

### Step 3: Setup Environment Variables

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
   
   # Mac/Linux
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Open `.env.local` in VS Code

3. Fill in your keys (see next section)

**Important**: Never commit `.env.local` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore` to protect your secrets.

### Step 4: Get Your API Keys

#### Clerk Keys (Authentication):
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Sign up/login
3. Create new application (or select existing)
4. Go to "API Keys" in sidebar
5. Copy:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
6. Paste into `.env.local`

#### Firebase Keys (Database & Storage):
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Sign up/login with Google account
3. Click "Create Project" (or select existing)
4. Add Web App (click `</>` icon)
5. Copy all config values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   ```
6. Paste into `.env.local`

### Step 5: Configure Firebase Rules

1. In Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Click "Rules" tab
3. Copy rules from `firebase-rules.txt` (Firestore section)
4. Paste and Publish

5. In Firebase Console → Storage
6. Click "Rules" tab
7. Copy rules from `firebase-rules.txt` (Storage section)
8. Paste and Publish

### Step 6: Configure Clerk Session Token

1. Go to Clerk Dashboard
2. Click "Sessions" in sidebar
3. Scroll to "Customize session token"
4. In the editor, add:
   ```json
   {
     "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
   }
   ```
5. Click "Save"

### Step 7: Run the App!

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔍 Understanding Key Concepts

### What is "Client" vs "Server" Components?

In Next.js, components can run in two places:

**Server Components** (default):
- Run on the server
- Can access databases directly
- Faster initial load
- Can't use browser features (clicks, state)

**Client Components** (`"use client"` at top):
- Run in the browser
- Can use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Can handle user interactions (clicks, forms)
- Can't access server secrets

**Example**:
```typescript
"use client"  // ← This makes it a client component

import { useState } from "react"

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)  // ← Only works in client
  
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    Count: {count}
  </button>
}
```

### What are Hooks?

Hooks are special React functions that start with `use`:

- **`useState`**: Store data that changes
  ```typescript
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  // name = current value
  // setName = function to update it
  ```

- **`useEffect`**: Run code when component loads
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    // This runs once when component appears
    fetchData()
  }, [])
  ```

- **`useUser`** (Clerk): Get current user info
  ```typescript
  const { user } = useUser()
  console.log(user?.emailAddress)
  ```

### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript = JavaScript + Types

**Types** tell the code what kind of data to expect:

```typescript
// Without types (JavaScript)
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name
}

// With types (TypeScript)
function greet(name: string) {
  return "Hello " + name
}

greet(123)  // ❌ TypeScript catches this error!
```

**Benefits**:
- Catches errors before running code
- Better autocomplete in VS Code
- Makes code easier to understand

| **Route** | URL path (like `/submit` or `/gallery`) |
| **API** | Way for code to communicate with external services |
| **Environment Variable** | Secret configuration stored in `.env.local` |
| **Hook** | Special React function (starts with `use`) |
| **Async/Await** | Way to wait for operations to complete |
| **Collection** | Folder in Firestore that holds documents |
