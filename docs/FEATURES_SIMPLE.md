## 🔒 Security Features

### 11. Access Control 🚪

**What it does**: Ensures only authorized users access certain pages  
**How it works**: Checks roles before showing content

**Protected Routes**:
```
/submit       → Must be signed in (Clerk)
/admin        → Must have admin role
/admin/users  → Must have admin role
```

**How it's enforced**:
```typescript
// Client-side (UX)
if (!user || role !== 'admin') {
  return <AccessDenied />
}

// Server-side (security)
if (!(await checkRole('admin'))) {
  redirect('/')
}
```

**Multiple layers**:
1. **Clerk Middleware** - Checks if signed in
2. **Client Component** - Shows/hides UI
3. **Server Component** - Redirects unauthorized users
4. **Server Actions** - Validates before database changes

- File type (only images)

**Behind the scenes**:
```typescript
// Check required fields
if (!formData.fullName || !formData.email) {
  toast({ title: "Error", description: "Please fill all fields" })
  return
}

// Check file size
if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
  toast({ title: "Error", description: "File too large (max 10MB)" })
  return
}
```

**Files involved**:

## 📊 Data Flow (How Everything Connects)

```
User Action
    ↓
React Component (UI)
    ↓
Event Handler (onClick, onSubmit)
    ↓
Client-Side Validation
    ↓
Firebase API Call
    ↓
Firebase (Storage / Firestore)
