rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /devfest2025Comp/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024;
    }
  }
}
```

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /DevFestComp2025/{submission} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
